## Rust Item Documentation Style

For public structs, traits, and enums, prefer a wrapped rustdoc block with the
item name as a short heading, a blank rustdoc line before and after the heading,
and a blank source line before attributes:

```rust
///
/// SchemaMetadata
///
/// Optional diagnostic metadata for an in-place store schema.
///
/// This metadata helps humans and frameworks diagnose which schema version was
/// declared in each generation. It is bounded and validated for durable ledger
/// encoding, but it does not perform application schema migrations or validate
/// stable data semantics.
///

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, Deserialize, Eq, PartialEq, Serialize)]
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]
pub struct SchemaMetadata {
    /// Optional in-place schema version.
    pub schema_version: Option<u32>,
}
```

Keep this shape for new or edited item-level docs unless local context clearly
requires a different style.
